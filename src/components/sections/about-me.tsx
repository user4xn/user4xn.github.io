            Curious about me? Here you have it:
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I work mostly as a back-end developer and am capable in Golang, PHP, and Node.JS.
            My areas of expertise are database management, creating RESTful APIs, and designing effective systems.
            I have experience with Agile approaches, and I&apos;m constantly willing to learn new things and sharpen my experience.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I started as a web developer in 2019 and have since learned new technologies and taken on new challenges. 
            Now in my early thirties, I use modern technologies like Golang, Laravel, Vue, and Tailwind to build innovative web applications.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I am an imaginative guy that enjoys working on projects from ideas to development.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
          Outside of work, i enjoy to ride along cities with my bike or just enganging conversation with my friend, 
          i have keen interest on automotive, music, and games.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>And now for a few brief facts about me.</Typography>
